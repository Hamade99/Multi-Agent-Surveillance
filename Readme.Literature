Video demonstratrion: https://youtu.be/_83aXKUHhHU

For this project, we programmed a multi-surveillance world in which multiple agents have to navigate, while completing certain tasks. The responsibilities of the agents
are as follows:

o Locating threats
o Finding areas with high probability of harboring threats 
o Difficulty of classifying threats
o UAV
o Flight performance constraints
o Navigation autonomy levels
o Camera image quality
o Operator
o Inherent skill
o Dynamic effects of workload, fatigue, and situational awareness
o Human-agent interaction 
o Level of automation 
o Interaction time
